## IMPORTANT NOTE
This repository is no longer maintained. Most specifically, Zengo will not provide any security updates or hotfixes (should an issue arise).
This library was originally created to enable users to experiment with MPC and TSS functionality using different protocols, including such that are not used in production by Zengo wallet.
Zengo walletâ€™s production MPC code can be found in [https://github.com/ZenGo-X/gotham-city/master](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/gotham-city/tree/master/)

## Introduction
This project is a Rust implementation of {t,n}-threshold ECDSA (elliptic curve digital signature algorithm).

Threshold ECDSA includes two protocols:

-   Key Generation for creating secret shares.
-   Signing for using the secret shares to generate a signature.

ECDSA is used extensively for crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (secp256k1 curve), NEO (NIST P-256 curve) and much more.
This library can be used to create MultiSig and ThresholdSig crypto wallet. For a full background on threshold signatures please read our Binance academy article [Threshold Signatures Explained](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/threshold-signatures-explained).

## Library Introduction
The library was built with four core design principles in mind:
1. Multi-protocol support
2. Built for cryptography engineers
3. Foolproof
4. Black box use of cryptographic primitives

To learn about the core principles as well as on the [audit](https://github.com/KZen-networks/multi-party-ecdsa/tree/master/audits) process and security of the library, please read our [Intro to multiparty ecdsa library](https://zengo.com/introducing-multi-party-ecdsa-library/) blog post.

## Use It


The library implements four different protocols for threshold ECDSA. The protocols presents different tradeoffs in terms of parameters, security assumptions and efficiency.

## Run GG20 Demo

In the following steps we will generate 2-of-3 threshold signing key and sign a message with 2 parties.

### Setup

1. You need [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and [GMP library](https://gmplib.org) (optionally) to be installed on your computer.
2. - Run `cargo build --release --examples`
   - Don't have GMP installed? Use this command instead: 
     ```bash
     cargo build --release --examples --no-default-features --features curv-kzen/num-bigint
     ```
     But keep in mind that it will be less efficient.

   Either of commands will produce binaries into `./target/release/examples/` folder.
3. `cd ./target/release/examples/`

### Start an SM server

`./gg20_sm_manager`

That will start an HTTP server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Other parties will use that server in order to communicate with
each other. Note that communication channels are neither encrypted nor authenticated. In production, you must encrypt and
authenticate parties messages.

### Run Keygen

Open 3 terminal tabs for each party. Run:

1. `./gg20_keygen -t 1 -n 3 -i 1 --output local-share1.json`
2. `./gg20_keygen -t 1 -n 3 -i 2 --output local-share2.json`
3. `./gg20_keygen -t 1 -n 3 -i 3 --output local-share3.json`

Each command corresponds to one party. Once keygen is completed, you'll have 3 new files:
`local-share1.json`, `local-share2.json`, `local-share3.json` corresponding to local secret
share of each party.

### Run Signing

Since we use 2-of-3 scheme (`t=1 n=3`), any two parties can sign a message. Run:

1. `./gg20_signing -p 1,2 -d "hello" -l local-share1.json`
2. `./gg20_signing -p 1,2 -d "hello" -l local-share2.json`

Each party will produce a resulting signature. `-p 1,2` specifies indexes of parties
who attends in signing (each party has an associated index given at keygen, see argument 
`-i`), `-l file.json` sets a path to a file with secret local share, and `-d "hello"`
is a message being signed.

### Running Demo on different computers

While previous steps show how to run keygen & signing on local computer, you actually can
run each party on dedicated machine. To do this, you should ensure that parties can reach
SM Server, and specify its address via command line argument, eg:

`./gg20_keygen --address http://10.0.1.9:8000/ ...`

## Run GG18 Demo

The following steps are for setup, key generation with `n` parties and signing with `t+1` parties.

### Setup

1.  We use shared state machine architecture (see [white city](https://github.com/KZen-networks/white-city)). The parameters `parties` and `threshold` can be configured by changing the file: `param`. a keygen will run with `parties` parties and signing will run with any subset of `threshold + 1` parties. `param` file should be located in the same path of the client software.

2.  Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/). Run `cargo build --release --examples` (it will build into `/target/release/examples/`)

3.  Run the shared state machine: `./gg18_sm_manager`. By default, it's configured to be in `127.0.0.1:8000`, this can be changed in `Rocket.toml` file. The `Rocket.toml` file should be in the same folder you run `sm_manager` from.

### KeyGen

run `gg18_keygen_client` as follows: `./gg18_keygen_client http://127.0.0.1:8000 keys.store`. Replace IP and port with the ones configured in setup. Once `n` parties join the application will run till finish. At the end each party will get a local keys file `keys.store` (change filename in command line). This contains secret and public data of the party after keygen. The file therefore should remain private.

### Sign

Run `./gg18_sign_client`. The application should be in the same folder as the `keys.store` file (or custom filename generated in keygen). the application takes three arguments: `IP:port` as in keygen, `filename` and message to be signed: `./gg18_sign_client http://127.0.0.1:8001 keys.store "KZen Networks"`. The same message should be used by all signers. Once `t+1` parties join the protocol will run and will output to screen signature (R,s).

The `./gg18_sign_client` executable initially tries to unhex its input message (the third parameter). Before running ensure two things:

1. If you want to pass a binary message to be signed - hex it.
2. If you want to pass a textual message in a non-hex form, make sure it can't be unhexed.
Simply put, the safest way to use the signing binary is to just always hex your messages before passing them to the `./gg18_sign_client` executable.

#### Example
To sign the message `hello world`, first calculate its hexadecimal representation. This yields the `68656c6c6f20776f726c64`.
Then, run:
```bash
./gg18_sign_client http://127.0.0.1:8000 keys.store "68656c6c6f20776f726c64"
```

### GG18 demo

Run `./run.sh` (located in `/demo` folder) in the main folder. Move `params` file to the same folder as the executables (usually `/target/release/examples`). The script will spawn a shared state machine, clients in the number of parties and signing requests for the `threshold + 1` first parties.

`gg18_sm_manager` rocket server runs in _production_ mode by default. You may modify the `./run.sh` to config it to run in different environments. For example, to run rocket server in _development_:
```
ROCKET_ENV=development ./target/release/examples/sm_manager
```
